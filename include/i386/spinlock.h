 * On UP systems, we don't need to lock anything. If the kernel were preemptive,
 * we would have to disable the preemption, but that's all. The spinlock holding
 * thread may only be preempted with an irq handler, and we use spinlock_irq_save
 * to lock data accessed by irq handlers. The counter is there only for debugging,
 * so it isn't even atomic.
